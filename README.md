A simple implementation of Blackjack to learn the fundamentals of programming in Python.
This is my submission for the final project for [Code in Place](https://codeinplace.stanford.edu/) by Stanford University.

Thanks to my husband for guidance and teaching me the basics of Object Oriented Programming.

Run it using the following command:
```
python main.py
```
